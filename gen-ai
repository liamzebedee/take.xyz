do the obvious thing


what's the obvious thing? 
people can collaboratively generate a collection together
and then sell it as nft's and download the jpegs'

ie.
mint your own "vibeshift" 
people type in some text
it generates an image or three
and then they pay the mint fee 
and they get a PFP



each prompt is based on someone elses prompt
you can see examples of the image below the prompt



people type a prompt
generate 4 pics 
iterate - tune with different aspects of their info:

select the one they like, hit mint
they are added to the collection



the core thing is-
being able to remix different takes
so you can search styles and takes:
- index all known artists and artwork styles







take is concept space
it's literally that
a place to make hot takes
which are a form of meta







pay with crypto
realtime chat
search different styles
