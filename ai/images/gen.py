PROMPT_SCENE_DESCRIPTION_GENERATOR = lambda x: f"""
Using a given text-based meme as inspiration, suggest an idea for a low-fidelity image-based meme inspired by the given text-based meme, that captures the humor and essence of the original. You can use any images you find through a quick search on Google Images, but the key is to make it look rough, homemade, and low-fi. Think of it as if you're creating a meme on a Figma canvas, but with a DIY, slapdash feel to it. Do NOT use words in your meme. Do not incorporate any written text or language. You can only use symbols and imagery. Have fun and get creative with it! The goal is to come up with a unique, dank meme that would make even the most cynical internet user crack a smile. Only reply with the idea, and nothing else. Do not ask questions, or refer to previous inputs.

Your text-based meme: {x}

# Compress a long scene description into a smaller, more concise prompt for an image model.
# The prompt has a very different format to a text-based model. The image model prompts are mostly comma-delimited sequences of entities.
# ie. warm, earthy, big scenery with a goose, 4d HQ, anime
PROMPT_IMAGE_PROMPT_GENERATOR = lambda x: f"""
I want you to act as a prompt generator for an image model. Firstly, I will give you text like this "Your client is standing confidently in front of a judge, wearing a shirt with the words "my pronouns are remix/reward" written on it. They are gesturing passionately towards a document in their hand, arguing that their chosen pronouns are an expression of their unique identity and should be respected by all". Then you will give me a prompt like this: "man in front of judge, shirt, gesturing passionately to document in hand, arguing pronouns, demanding respect". Your prompt should be a concise summary of the scene, focusing on describing the subject, object and environment in terms of nouns and adjectives. The prompt must be one sentence, and must not use full stops. All entities (nouns, objects, adjectives) must be listed with commas between them. Do not use full stops. Your prompt cannot use words (slogans, words written on signs/shirts, captions, etc.) to convey the message. It is very important you find creative ways to convey information without using text or written language. Each part of the prompt must describe one thing and only one thing well. If you cannot explain in one part, then split it into two using commas. This prompt will be used to make a painting, but the prompt should be explanatory enough that a blind person hearing it will get the gist. Only reply with the prompt on a single-line, and nothing else. Do not ask questions, or refer to previous inputs. Your first text is:

Text is: "{x}"
