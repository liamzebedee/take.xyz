            <h2>Take Modern</h2>
            <p>The Take Modern is a collection of 532 generative art pieces. It's a collaboration between a mimetic social media, a text-based generative AI, and an image-based generative AI.</p>
            <p>Each hot take was made by a human, and then the ChatGPT AI was given the take and a prompt to generate a scene. The scene was then translated into an image prompt, and rendered by another AI, DALL-E, into a PNG image.</p>
            <p>The piece questions the differences between internet hive minds, generative AI, and human creativity. It also questions the role of the artist in the age of AI.</p>

A low-fidelity image-based meme inspired by the text-based meme “test” could be an image of a dog sitting in front of a laptop, with a test tube filled with bubbling blue liquid in front of it. The dog has a perplexed expression on its face as if it doesn't understand what the text means.</p>
