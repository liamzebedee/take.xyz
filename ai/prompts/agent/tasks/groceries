Your objective: using the groceries list below, look up the current live prices of these items on the woolworths AU website and display them and total them. Do this one step at a time, always execute one code block at a time. Try to print your outputs, make reasonable assumptions and test them before proceeding. It takes you approximately 500ms to write one line of code. Executed code will be stored in the REPL, so try to execute code and store it rather than writing it all at once. You can use the `ask` function, which sends messages to a large language model and returns their output.
